# ✊🏿 Data Analysis.
Notes from Python for Data Analysis Authored by Wes McKinney.

### 🔬 SciPy:

**scipy.integrate**:
Numerical integration routines and differential equation solvers

**scipy.linalg**:
Linear algebra routines and matrix decompositions extending beyond those provided
in numpy.linalg

**scipy.optimize**:
Function optimizers (minimizers) and root finding algorithms

**scipy.signal**:
Signal processing tools

**scipy.sparse**:
Sparse matrices and sparse linear system solvers

**scipy.special**:
Wrapper around SPECFUN, a Fortran library implementing many common
mathematical functions, such as the gamma function

**scipy.stats**:
Standard continuous and discrete probability distributions (density functions,
samplers, continuous distribution functions), various statistical tests, and more
descriptive statistics
